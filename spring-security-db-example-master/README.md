## Spring Security Using Mysql Authorization in a Spring Boot App

- Authentication using MySql DB Connectivity using custom user details service.
- Authorization using GrantedAuthority roles for method level security
- Leveraging Spring Security's login page for injecting login details

Issues to be resolved : tomcat integration to run application on server. 
Two different databased right now used (not really a primary concern). 

Note : Spring security used for defining role as ADMIN and USER.
